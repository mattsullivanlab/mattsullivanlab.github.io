## About Our Lab

We study the roles of microbes in health and disease using cutting-edge techniques in gene structure and function, genomics, microscopy, and bioinformatics. Our primary focus is Group B streptococcus (*Streptococcus agalactiae*), an important pathogen of humans and animals. Our goal is to develop a better understanding of how this organism thrives in the human body and exploits metabolic processes in order to gain an advantage in a host-niche.
