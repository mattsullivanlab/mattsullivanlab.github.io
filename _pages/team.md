## Dr Matt Sullivan
Matt trained in the microbial genetics lab of Prof Andy Johnston at UEA where he completed his PhD identifying new genes required for dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) catabolism in bacteria. Matt then joined the Centre for Molecular and Structural Biochemistry at UEA as a BBSRC-funded Postdoc in 2011 where he identified a novel regulatory role for copper (Cu) in controlling expression of nitrous oxide reductase (NosZ), in collaboration with Prof David Richardson, A/Prof Gary Rowley and A/Prof Andrew Gates. Matt joined Prof Glen Ulettâ€™s lab in 2014 at Griffith University in the Gold Coast (Australia) as a Research Fellow, working on numerous NHMRC-funded projects examining virulence and pathogenesis of E. coli and Streptococcus. During this time Matt developed his own interests in understanding how pathogenic bacteria sense and respond to extracellular stressors in the context of health and disease. In 2022, Matt returned to UEA to establish his own independent group as Lecturer in Molecular Microbiology and Research Group Leader in the School of Biological Sciences. Matt is a keen cricketer and enjoys taking in the outdoors, especially with trips to the Norfolk Broads where the lab sometimes celebrates key milestones.
